## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) - JS library

### What I learned

I got more familiar with CSS Flexbox and using CSS in tandem with Bootstrap 5.

### Continued development

I think I still need to work on some of my more advanced skills such as JavaScript & related frameworks.

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap 5 Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) - Helped me along my way of using CSS & Bootstrap 5 together.
